## Testing Philosophy

Our testing strategy follows the **Testing Pyramid** approach:
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated tests for business logic
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Database and service integration
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Critical user flows and scenarios

### Key Testing Principles
✅ **Double-booking Prevention**: Tested at DB constraint and application levels  
✅ **Idempotency**: Verified through unit and E2E tests  
✅ **Concurrency**: Load tests simulate race conditions  
✅ **Authorization**: Role-based access control validation  
✅ **Edge Cases**: Past appointments, cancelled appointments, deleted slots

---

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Tests

**Location**: `src/**/*.spec.ts`

#### Appointments Service (`appointments.service.spec.ts`)
Tests 4 core methods with comprehensive scenarios:

**createAppointment()**
- ✅ Successful appointment creation
- ✅ Idempotency key reuse (returns existing appointment)
- ✅ Slot not found (404)
- ✅ Deleted slot rejection (400)
- ✅ Past appointment prevention (400)
- ✅ Double-booking prevention (409)

**listAppointments()**
- ✅ Patient role filter (own appointments only)
- ✅ Doctor role filter (their patients only)
- ✅ Admin role (all appointments)
- ✅ Status filtering (BOOKED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
- ✅ Date range filtering
- ✅ Pagination (page, limit, total, totalPages)

**getAppointmentById()**
- ✅ Patient access (own appointment)
- ✅ Doctor access (their patient's appointment)
- ✅ Admin access (any appointment)
- ✅ Not found (404)
- ✅ Unauthorized access (403)

**cancelAppointment()**
- ✅ Successful cancellation
- ✅ Already cancelled (400)
- ✅ Completed appointment (400)
- ✅ Past appointment (400)
- ✅ Unauthorized (403)
- ✅ Not found (404)

**Coverage Goals**: > 85% code coverage for business logic

---

### 2. Integration Tests

**Location**: `src/**/*.integration.spec.ts`

#### Database Operations
- ✅ Prisma client integration
- ✅ Transaction handling
- ✅ Constraint validation (unique_booked_slot)
- ✅ Cascading deletes
- ✅ Soft deletes (deletedAt)

#### Concurrent Booking Tests
- ✅ Multiple users booking same slot
- ✅ Database-level locking
- ✅ Retry logic verification

---

### 3. E2E Tests

**Location**: `test/appointment-flow.e2e-spec.ts`

#### Complete Booking Lifecycle
```
Doctor creates schedule → Patient browses doctors → 
Patient books appointment → Patient views appointment → 
Patient cancels appointment
```

**Scenarios Tested**:
1. **Happy Path**
   - Create appointment → View details → List appointments → Cancel

2. **Idempotency**
   - Duplicate requests with same idempotency key return same appointment

3. **Double-Booking Prevention**
   - Two patients cannot book the same slot
   - Second request receives 409 Conflict

4. **Past Appointment Prevention**
   - Cannot book slots in the past (400)
   - Cannot cancel past appointments (400)

5. **Schedule Management**
   - Doctor creates daily schedule
   - System generates 30-min slots
   - Slots appear in availability API

**Test Data Setup**:
- Creates: 1 doctor, 2 patients, multiple time slots
- Cleanup: Automatic teardown after suite
- Isolation: Each test has independent data

---

### 4. Load Tests

**Location**: `test/load/appointment-booking.yml`

#### Load Test Phases
```
Phase 1: Warm-up (60s)        → 5 users/sec
Phase 2: Ramp-up (120s)       → 10 → 50 users/sec
Phase 3: Peak Load (180s)     → 50 users/sec (sustained)
Phase 4: Spike Test (60s)     → 100 users/sec
Phase 5: Cool Down (60s)      → 20 users/sec
```

#### Test Scenarios (Weighted)
- **60%** - Patient Booking Flow  
  Browse doctors → Check availability → Book → View details
  
- **25%** - View My Appointments  
  List appointments with filters
  
- **10%** - Doctor Views Schedule  
  Check appointments and availability
  
- **5%** - Concurrent Slot Booking  
  Multiple users attempt to book same slot (race condition test)

#### Performance Thresholds
- **Max Error Rate**: < 1%
- **P95 Response Time**: < 2 seconds
- **P99 Response Time**: < 5 seconds

#### What We're Testing
✅ **Throughput**: Requests per second handling  
✅ **Latency**: Response time under load  
✅ **Race Conditions**: Concurrent booking attempts  
✅ **Database Locking**: Unique constraint enforcement  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure under stress

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing Due to Database Connection
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Restart database
docker-compose restart postgres

# Reset database
npm run prisma:migrate reset
```

### Load Tests Not Starting
```bash
# Check Artillery installation
npx artillery version

# Verify test data exists
npm run db:seed

# Run with verbose logging
npx artillery run --output report.json test/load/appointment-booking.yml
```

### Coverage Reports Not Generating
```bash
# Clean coverage directory
rm -rf coverage/

# Run with coverage
npm run test:cov

# View HTML report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures the Clinic Appointment System is:
- **Functionally correct** (unit + integration tests)
- **Reliable under load** (load tests)
- **Handles edge cases** (E2E tests)
- **Prevents critical bugs** (double-booking, idempotency)
- **Ready for production** (comprehensive test coverage)

**Current Status**: Core modules tested, load tests configured, ready for execution phase.

**Recommendation**: Execute full test suite → analyze results → optimize if needed → deploy to staging.
